# What is this?

A place for me to document the things I learn. It's a reference for me mostly.

# Who am I?

I'm Brett Roper. Professionally an Oracle developer - but on the side I've also done web stuff since 1994, wasted time on the internet since 1990, programmed the first Mac, Apple IIs and other 8 bit machines. I've even used punch cards (my high school was retro).

Off the computer I am getting back into surfing. I make things with wood and am fixing up an old yacht.

The photo of Sugar Loaf Rock above is near where I grew up.
