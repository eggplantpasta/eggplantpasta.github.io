# Mt Meharry

After my first attempt was thwarted by a broken camper trailer in 2020 I finally made it up in 2022.

## First attempt

My first attempt in October 2020 was as a side trip on the way back from Karijini. The road in had the worst corrugations I'd ever experienced and it resulted in a broken camper trailer before we even made it to the turn off. We did a bush repair on the 1980's era leaf spring and limped back to Perth.

## Second attempt and success

On the second attempt, also on the return from Karijini, we were in my absolutely not a 4WD Honda C-RV. Despite the lack of an appropriate vehicle we not only made it over the corrugations from hell to the turn off but also down the was-not-exaggerating 4WD only track to the start of the walk.

We arrived later than intended in the increasingly hot day but packed water and started the 10km hike up and back. The views were beautiful but it was dusty and exhausting. So happy to have finally made it.
