The toughest peak so far.

## Mistake one

After flying in from Perth to Brisbane to Townsville I rented a car and drove to the start of the walk. Which I discovered was right near Cairns. Which I could have got a direct flight to and avoided hours of unnecessary driving. Doh.

## The climb

The jungle of poison trees was beautiful. There were leech filled rivers and creeks that looked so pretty. The walk got steeper and steeper till I was pulling myself forward by grabbing onto branches. Up and up till near the top I had to cross a field of large boulders hanging onto metal rails and chains.

## Mistake two

Just below the summit, where I camped the night, had really amazing sunsets and sunrises. The dew was as heavy as rain.

Don't leave food in your backpack. Queensland mountain marsupials have sharp teeth. Doh again.

## Summit and descent

The summit was surrounded by vegetation so no views were to be had. The walk down was as hard as the walk up. It hurt. 

The totally unnecessary drive back was rushed so I could make it to the plane on time. Which was delayed for hours (of course).

I was destroyed but happy. Another one down.
