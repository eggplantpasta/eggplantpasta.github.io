=======================

My [GitHub Blog](http://eggplantpasta.github.io/)

Use [these](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) instructions to get started with Jekyll on GitHub Pages.

**Note:** Because these are user pages you publish by pushing to the [master branch](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages); a gh-pages branch is not required.
