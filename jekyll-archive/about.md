# What is this?

A place for me to document the things I learn. Especially those jobs I do rarely and forget what I learened before the next time. It's a reference for me mostly.

# Who am I?

I'm Brett Roper. Professionally an Oracle developer with experience in Drupal and web technologies - but on the side I've also done web stuff since 1994, wasted time on the internet since 1990, programmed the first Mac, Apple IIs, and other 8 bit machines. I've even used punch cards (my high school was retro). Dude, I sound old.

Off the computer I don't surf enough, and have taken up ramp skating again because of my kids. I make things with wood and am helping Dad build a yacht.

The photo of Sugar Loaf Rock above is near where I grew up.
